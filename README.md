0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

In this project we write a command interpreter that will manage the AirBnb objects
Using this command interpreter we'll be able to:
--> create a new object
--> retrieve an object from a file, database
--> do operations on the objectseg count ets
--> update attributes of an object and 
--> destroy an object

To use the interpreter, run the executable file, a prompt is given. 
You can be able to pass commands on the promt and once you click ENTER a desired output is given.

Example
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help
